# :turtle:Using Python's Turtle Graphics Library to Draw Concentric Circles

## Features‚ú®
- Creates a pattern of concentric circles
- Each set of circles is drawn in a different direction

## Installationüíª

To run this project, you need Python installed on your machine. 

## How it worksüîç
- The project uses Python's Turtle library to create 4 sets of concentric circles
- The ```draw_circles``` function takes in the turtles's name, a starting radius, the number of circles, and an angle to turn the turtle after each set
- The radius of each circle increases by 25 units in each loop to create the concentric effect

## Play aroundüé®
- Circle Count: Change the ```count``` value in each call to ```draw_circles``` to draw more or fewer circles per set
- Starting Radius: Change the ```start_radius``` value to make larger or smaller circles initially
- Angle: Modify the ```angle``` value to create different rotational patterns
